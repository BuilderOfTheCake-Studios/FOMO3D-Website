<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
<p>
FOMO3D is a BEP-20 token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain. The token design focuses on supply immutability, a predictable reflection mechanism, and a multi-unit denomination system inspired by granular time measurement. The project establishes a base asset that supports on-chain applications, reward systems, and microeconomic structures. This document describes the design rationale, supply structure, reflection model, denomination hierarchy, and system architecture.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Digital assets often rely on variable supply, burn mechanics, or inflationary components. FOMO3D takes a fixed-supply approach with an integrated reflection model that distributes a portion of transactional volume to holders. This structure supports a predictable economic environment while incentivizing long-term participation.
</p>

<p>
The token uses the symbol <strong>ⴵ</strong>, represented visually as an hourglass. This symbol reflects the relationship between small divisible units and the passage of time. The token is intended to function as a foundational resource inside an expanding ecosystem of applications.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Design Goals</h2>
<p>
The token architecture is based on the following goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed Supply:</strong> Preserve long-term scarcity without minting or expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Passive Distribution:</strong> Provide predictable reflection rewards during transactional activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit Hierarchy:</strong> Support precise value subdivision through a multi-tier denomination system.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Maintain adherence to the BEP-20 standard and BSC network tooling.</li>
  <li><strong>Ecosystem Utility:</strong> Enable use within future applications and cryptographic environments.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4. Token Specification</h2>

<h3>4.1 Supply</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> ⴵ1,000,000</li>
  <li><strong>Minting:</strong> Disabled permanently</li>
  <li><strong>Burning:</strong> Tokens can be permanently removed from the supply</li>
  <li><strong>Decimals:</strong> 18</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Contract Information</h3>
<p>
The smart contract is deployed at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x99f338D4282Ea8A9702eDaAbd06FDa1050d6AAD8">
0x99f338D4282Ea8A9702eDaAbd06FDa1050d6AAD8
</a>
</p>
<p>
The implementation follows the BEP-20 interface standard including <code>transfer</code>, <code>approve</code>, <code>transferFrom</code>, and balance methods.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Reflection Model</h3>
<p>
A reflection fee of 10% is applied to each transfer. The collected amount is distributed proportionally to all token holders. The distribution mechanism operates without staking, lockups, or manual claims. Rewards accumulate as a natural result of network activity.
</p>

<p>
The reflection process functions as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A transfer request is submitted.</li>
  <li>10% of the amount is separated as a reflection fee.</li>
  <li>The remaining 90% is transferred to the recipient.</li>
  <li>The reflection portion is allocated to holders according to their relative share of the total supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This mechanism increases individual balances gradually whenever transactional activity occurs.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>5. Denomination Structure</h2>
<p>
FOMO3D introduces a unit hierarchy modeled on granular time measurement. This structure creates intuitive categories for different scales of transactions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Talent (ⵐ):</strong> ⴵ60,000</li>
  <li><strong>FOMO (ⴵ):</strong> Base unit</li>
  <li><strong>Mina (ⵠ):</strong> ⴵ0.01</li>
  <li><strong>Grain (ⴾ):</strong> ⴵ0.0001</li>
</ul>

<p>
The hierarchy supports both large and micro-scale transfers. It also establishes a framework for future applications that rely on precise fractional units. There are only 16.66 total Talent in the supply.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>6. Ecosystem Overview</h2>
<p>
The token is designed to function as a base utility asset for multiple applications. These applications operate independently and use FOMO3D as a transactional or redeemable component.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prize Wheel Faucet:</strong> Randomized reward distribution system</li>
  <li><strong>NFT Redemption:</strong> Exchange process for blockchain-based collectibles</li>
  <li><strong>Community Systems:</strong> Access controls based on token holdings</li>
  <li><strong>VR and Digital Environments:</strong> Planned expansions</li>
</ul>

<p>
The design allows new applications to be introduced without altering the original token contract.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>7. Security Considerations</h2>
<p>
The contract operates on a fixed supply with no owner-controlled minting functions. Reflection logic is deterministic and integrated into each transfer. Standard BEP-20 approval patterns apply.
</p>

<p>
Holders are responsible for securing private keys and verifying contract addresses when interacting with external platforms.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
FOMO3D provides a fixed-supply token with an integrated reflection model and a structured unit hierarchy. The design supports a stable foundation for applications that require predictable supply behavior and passive distribution features. Future development will extend the utility of the token across additional on-chain and off-chain systems.
